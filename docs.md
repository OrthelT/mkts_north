**Sync Status Indicators:**
- Last ESI Update: Shows when market data was last updated from ESI
- Last Sync: Shows when the local database was last synchronized with the remote database
- Next Scheduled Sync: Shows when the next automatic sync will occur
- Status: Indicates success or failure of the most recent sync

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Market Analysis
- Check the "Days Remaining" metric to identify items that need immediate attention
- Use the price history chart to identify trends and price fluctuations
- Compare market stock with "Fits on Market" to understand if stock levels are adequate

### For Doctrine Management
- Focus on ships marked as "Critical" on the Doctrine Status page
- Pay attention to the "Low Stock Modules" section to identify bottlenecks
- Use the export feature to create shopping lists for restocking

### Performance Tips
- The application caches data for 60 seconds to improve performance
- Database syncs are scheduled to minimize disruption
- Large data queries are processed in batches to prevent timeouts

## Troubleshooting

**Sync Fails:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Turso credentials are correct in your environment variables
- Check the logs directory for detailed error messages

**No Data Appears:**
- Confirm the database has been synced at least once
- Check filters to ensure they're not too restrictive
- Verify that the selected items exist in the market database

**Slow Performance:**
- Large datasets may take longer to process
- Consider using more specific filters
- Wait for the initial data load to complete before changing filters
